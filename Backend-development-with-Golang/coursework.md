  - Syntax, types, variables
  - Control structures: if, for, switch
- **Week 2:** Functions and Packages
  - Writing functions, methods
  - Creating and using packages
- **Week 3:** Advanced Go Features
  - Interfaces, error handling
  - Concurrency: goroutines, channels

### Module 2: Building Web Applications with Go
- **Week 4:** HTTP Server and Client
  - Creating a basic web server
  - Handling requests and responses
- **Week 5:** Working with Databases

### Capstone Project
- **Weeks 15-16:** Capstone Project
  - Students will apply what they've learned to build a full-fledged backend system. This system will include a set of microservices, real-time messaging capabilities, secured with OAuth2, and deployed on Kubernetes.
  - The project will culminate in a presentation where students demonstrate their deployed applications, discuss the architecture, and reflect on the development process.

### Additional Resources
- Recommended reading materials and official documentation for deeper understanding.
- Weekly office hours for Q&A and discussion on advanced topics.
- Access to a community forum for peer support and knowledge sharing.

This course aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge to build scalable, efficient, and secure backend systems using Go and modern development practices. By the end of the course, students will be well-prepared to tackle real-world backend development challenges.
