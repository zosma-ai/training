Designing a comprehensive bachelor's-level course on Generative AI (GenAI) involves crafting a curriculum that balances theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and ethical considerations. Such a course would aim to equip students with a deep understanding of generative models, including their architecture, applications, and the implications of their use. Below is an outline for a semester-long course titled "Introduction to Generative AI".

### Course Title: Introduction to Generative AI

#### Course Description:
This course introduces the principles and applications of Generative AI, focusing on how these algorithms can generate new content, including text, images, videos, and music. It covers the fundamentals of machine learning, deep learning architectures used in GenAI, and explores the ethical implications of generative technologies. Through lectures, hands-on labs, and projects, students will learn to build and evaluate their own generative models.
