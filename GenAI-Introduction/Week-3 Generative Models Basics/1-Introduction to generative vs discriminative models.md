# Introduction to Generative Models with PyTorch

Generative models have revolutionized the way we think about machine learning, enabling computers not just to learn from data, but also to generate new instances of data that resemble the original dataset. These models have broad applications, including image generation, natural language processing, and even creating new video content. This tutorial introduces the concept of generative models, starting with a basic implementation in PyTorch and setting the stage for future exploration of more complex models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models.

## What are Generative Models?

Generative models aim to learn the distribution of a dataset and generate new data points with similar characteristics. Unlike discriminative models that learn the boundary between different classes, generative models can create new examples that could plausibly belong to the training dataset.

Two popular types of generative models are:

1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** A framework consisting of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, competing against each other.
2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Models that learn to encode data to a latent space and reconstruct it back, ensuring the output closely matches the input.
