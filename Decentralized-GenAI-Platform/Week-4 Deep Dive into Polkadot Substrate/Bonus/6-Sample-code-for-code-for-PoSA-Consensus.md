Designing a Hybrid Proof of Stake and Activity (PoSA) consensus algorithm in Substrate requires careful planning and a deep understanding of both consensus mechanisms. The idea behind PoSA is to combine the security and efficiency of Proof of Stake (PoS) with an activity-based mechanism that rewards participants based on their contributions to the network's operations, beyond just stake.

This example will outline the steps and provide code snippets to guide you through implementing a basic PoSA consensus mechanism using Substrate. Note that this example assumes familiarity with Rust and Substrate development concepts.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Substrate Node Template

Start with a fresh Substrate node template. Ensure your development environment is ready, with Rust and Substrate prerequisites installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template.git
cd substrate-node-template
```

### Step 2: Defining the PoSA Consensus Logic

You'll need to modify the runtime to introduce the PoSA consensus logic. This involves creating a new module in your runtime that handles both the stake-based selection of validators and tracking of activities.

```rust
// in /runtime/src/posa.rs

pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    // Define hooks for your PoSA logic, e.g., on_finalize, on_initialize
}

decl_storage! {
    trait Store for Module<T: Config> as PoSAModule {
        // Store for validator stakes
        ValidatorStakes get(fn validator_stakes): map hasher(blake2_128_concat) T::AccountId => BalanceOf<T>;
        // Store for validator activities
        ValidatorActivities get(fn validator_activities): map hasher(blake2_128_concat) T::AccountId => u32;
    }
}

decl_module! {
    pub struct Module<T: Config> for enum Call where origin: T::Origin {
        // Initialization, staking, activity tracking, and validator selection logic goes here
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implementing Staking Logic

In your PoSA module, implement the logic for validators to stake tokens. This involves creating transactions that allow users to stake tokens, which makes them eligible to become validators.

```rust
// In /runtime/src/posa.rs within decl_module!

fn stake(origin, amount: BalanceOf<T>) -> DispatchResult {
    let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;

    // Logic to add or increase stake
    <ValidatorStakes<T>>::insert(sender, amount);

    Ok(())
}
```

### Step 4: Tracking and Rewarding Activity

Define what constitutes "activity" in your network (e.g., producing blocks, participating in governance). Implement logic to track these activities and reward validators accordingly.

```rust
// Use hooks like on_finalize to track activities

fn on_finalize(n: T::BlockNumber) {
    // Example: Increment activity count for block producers
    let producer = <frame_system::Module<T>>::block_producer();
    <ValidatorActivities<T>>::mutate(producer, |activity| *activity += 1);
}
```

### Step 5: Validator Selection Based on PoSA

Implement the logic for selecting validators based on their stake and activities. This could be a simple algorithm that ranks validators by their stake multiplied by their activity level.

```rust
fn select_validators() -> Vec<T::AccountId> {
    // Simplified example: Select top N validators based on stake * activity
    <ValidatorStakes<T>>::iter()
        .map(|(validator, stake)| {
            let activity = <ValidatorActivities<T>>::get(&validator);
            (validator, stake * BalanceOf<T>::from(activity))
        })
        .sorted_by(|a, b| b.1.cmp(&a.1))
        .take(N)
        .map(|(validator, _)| validator)
        .collect()
}
```

### Step 6: Integration with Substrate's Consensus Framework

Integrate your PoSA consensus logic with Substrate's broader consensus framework. This involves modifying the `node/src/service.rs` to utilize your custom PoSA module for block production and finalization.

### Final Thoughts

This example provides a foundational approach to implementing a Hybrid Proof of Stake and Activity consensus mechanism in Substrate. Real-world usage would require extensive testing, security analysis, and possibly adjustments to the Substrate framework itself to fully integrate and optimize your custom consensus algorithm.

Remember, blockchain development, especially consensus mechanisms, is complex and critical for network security. Thoroughly research and test any consensus algorithm in simulated environments before considering deployment.
