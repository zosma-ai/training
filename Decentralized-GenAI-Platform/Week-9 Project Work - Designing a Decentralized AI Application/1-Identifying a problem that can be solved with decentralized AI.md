# Tutorial: Identifying Problems Solvable with Decentralized AI

Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) leverages blockchain technology to distribute AI computations and data across multiple nodes, ensuring transparency, security, and democratization of AI technologies. This tutorial guides you through identifying problems that can be solved with decentralized AI, complemented by a list of topics for further research.

## Understanding Decentralized AI

Decentralized AI integrates blockchain with AI, allowing for:
- Secure data sharing without central control.
- Collaborative model training and inference without relinquishing data ownership.
- Transparent and verifiable AI operations.

### Identifying Suitable Problems

When identifying problems that decentralized AI can solve, consider the following criteria:
1. **Data Privacy and Security**: Situations where data privacy is paramount, and centralized data storage is a risk.
2. **Need for Trust and Transparency**: Domains requiring audit trails for AI decisions.
3. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Scenarios where multiple entities benefit from sharing AI insights without sharing the underlying data.
4. **Decentralization and Accessibility**: Problems where a decentralized approach can democratize access to AI technologies.

### Problem Areas Ideal for Decentralized AI

1. **Healthcare Data Analysis**: Patient data can be analyzed collaboratively across institutions without compromising patient privacy, enhancing diagnosis and treatment while maintaining data security through blockchain.

2. **Supply Chain Optimization**: Decentralized AI can provide transparent and tamper-proof monitoring of supply chains, optimizing operations based on real-time data without central control.

3. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: AI models can analyze market trends and predict financial risks in a decentralized finance ecosystem, with blockchain ensuring the integrity and transparency of financial transactions and predictions.

4. **Fraud Detection**: Implementing AI for fraud detection in a decentralized manner, where transactions across networks can be analyzed without a central point of failure, enhancing security.

5. **Energy Distribution**: In smart grids, decentralized AI can optimize energy distribution and consumption, with blockchain ensuring transparent and secure transactions between producers and consumers.
