Creating a Polkadot Substrate runtime involves a series of steps that guide you through setting up your development environment, creating a new Substrate-based blockchain, and developing custom runtime logic to meet your blockchain's specific needs. Here's a comprehensive tutorial to get you started:

### 1. Setup Development Environment

#### Prerequisites:
- **Rust:** Substrate is built with Rust, so you'll need to install Rust and the `cargo` package manager. Use rustup for easy installation and management.

  ```
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

- **Node.js and Yarn:** For frontend development, install Node.js and Yarn. These will help you interact with your Substrate node.

  ```
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  npm install --global yarn
  ```

- **Substrate Development Kit:** Install the Substrate development kit to get started with creating your blockchain.

  ```
  curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
  ```

### 2. Create a New Substrate Chain


- Use the Substrate Developer Hub Node Template as a starting point for your new chain.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
  cd substrate-node-template
  cargo build --release
  ```

For detailed description of building a local node, refer https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/build-a-blockchain/build-local-blockchain/

### 3. Explore the Substrate Node Template

- **Understand the Structure:** Familiarize yourself with the directory structure and the role of key files.
- **Runtime Logic:** The core of your blockchain's logic resides in the `runtime/src/lib.rs` file. This is where you will spend most of your development time.

### 4. Develop Your Runtime

- **Pallets:** Substrate uses pallets (modules) to add functionality to the blockchain. You can either use existing pallets from the Substrate framework or develop your own.

  - **Using Existing Pallets:** Integrate existing pallets into your runtime by modifying the `runtime/src/lib.rs` file.
  - **Creating Custom Pallets:** For custom functionality, you'll need to create your own pallets. Start by creating a new Rust module under the `pallets/` directory.

    ```
    cargo new --lib my_custom_pallet
    ```

- **Runtime Configuration:** Configure your runtime by editing the `runtime/src/lib.rs` file. This involves specifying which pallets are included in your runtime and how they are configured.

### 5. Test Your Runtime

- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for your custom pallets to ensure they behave as expected.
- **Runtime Integration Tests:** Use the Substrate framework's testing capabilities to simulate block production and execute transactions.

  ```
  cargo test -p my_custom_pallet
  ```

### 6. Launch Your Blockchain

- **Start Your Node:** Once your runtime is developed and tested, start your node.

  ```
  ./target/release/node-template --dev
  ```

- **Interact with Your Node:** Use the Polkadot-JS Apps interface to interact with your node. Connect to your local node and try submitting transactions or querying the state.

### 7. Next Steps

- **Explore Advanced Features:** Dive deeper into Substrate's capabilities, such as off-chain workers, smart contracts, and more.
- **Join the Community:** Engage with the Substrate and Polkadot communities for support, to share your project, and to stay updated on the latest developments.

This tutorial covers the basics to get you started with Substrate runtime development. As you become more comfortable, you'll discover the flexibility and power of the Substrate framework and Polkadot ecosystem. Happy building!
