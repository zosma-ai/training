# Hands-on Tutorial: Training a Simple AI Model with a Large Language Model (LLM)

This tutorial will guide you through the process of training a simple AI model using an open-source Large Language Model (LLM). We'll use Hugging Face's Transformers library, which provides easy access to pre-trained models like GPT-2, a widely recognized LLM for generating human-like text. This guide is aimed at beginners and will cover the essentials of setting up your environment, preparing your dataset, and training your model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with PyTorch or TensorFlow (We'll use PyTorch in this example)

## Step 1: Environment Setup

First, create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries. The Transformers library by Hugging Face simplifies working with LLMs like GPT-2.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv llm-tutorial-env

# Activate the environment
# On Windows
llm-tutorial-env\Scripts\activate.bat
# On Unix or MacOS
source llm-tutorial-env/bin/activate

# Install the necessary libraries
pip install torch transformers
```

## Step 2: Prepare Your Dataset

For training, you'll need a dataset. You can use any text dataset as per your interest or requirement. For simplicity, let's use a publicly available dataset like the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset, which contains excerpts from Shakespeare's works.

Save your dataset in a file named `dataset.txt`. Ensure the data is cleaned and pre-processed according to your needs (e.g., removing unnecessary symbols, lowercasing).

## Step 3: Loading and Preparing the Dataset

Use the Transformers library to tokenize your dataset. Tokenization converts raw text into a format that's suitable for the model to process (i.e., a sequence of integers).

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer

# Load the pre-trained tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Tokenize the dataset
def tokenize_dataset(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    examples = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus(lines, add_special_tokens=True, padding=True, return_tensors="pt")
    return examples["input_ids"], examples["attention_mask"]

input_ids, attention_masks = tokenize_dataset('dataset.txt')
```

## Step 4: Initializing the Model

Initialize the GPT-2 model for training. We'll also specify some training parameters.

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, Trainer, TrainingArguments

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./gpt2_finetuned",
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
)
```

## Step 5: Training the Model

Now, let's train the model using the `Trainer` class. The training might take some time, depending on your dataset size and computing resources.

```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class SimpleDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, encodings):
        self.encodings = encodings

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.encodings.input_ids)

dataset = SimpleDataset({"input_ids": input_ids, "attention_mask": attention_masks})

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset
)

trainer.train()
```

## Step 6: Testing the Model

After training, you can test the model by generating text.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the trained model
model_path = "./gpt2_finetuned"
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_path)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Initialize the pipeline
text_generator = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device=0)

# Generate text
generated = text_generator("To be or not to be", max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)

print(generated[0]['generated_text'])
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully trained a simple AI model using a Large Language Model (LLM) with the Hugging Face Transformers library. Experiment with different datasets, models, and training parameters to explore the vast possibilities of generative AI.


# **Generating proof of model training**
Generating proof of model training in a decentralized environment like Substrate requires a reliable mechanism that verifies the completion and integrity of the training process without central oversight. This challenge can be approached by leveraging cryptographic techniques, consensus mechanisms, and Substrate's extensible architecture. Here's a suggested methodology to achieve this:

### 1. Cryptographic Hashing

Use cryptographic hashes to create a unique fingerprint of the training data, model architecture, and training results. This hash can serve as a proof of the training process.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Before training starts, preprocess the training dataset to ensure consistency (e.g., ordering, formatting). Then, compute the cryptographic hash of the preprocessed dataset.
- **Model Hashing**: Similarly, create a hash of the model's initial state and architecture. This could include the model's weights (before training), hyperparameters, and any other relevant configurations.
- **Training Output**: After the model has been trained, generate a hash of the final model weights and the training metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss).

### 2. Training Log and Checkpoints

Maintain a detailed log and checkpoints during the training process. Each log entry and checkpoint can be hashed and linked to form a hash chain, adding to the proof of training progress and integrity.

- **Logging**: Record key events (e.g., epoch completions, metric improvements) and their timestamps during training. Hash each log entry and include the hash of the previous entry to form a chain.
- **Checkpoints**: Periodically save the model's state during training. Hash these checkpoints and include them in the training log.

### 3. On-Chain Registration

Once training is complete, register the training proof on the Substrate blockchain. This includes the initial data hash, model hash, final output hash, and the hash of the final training log.

- **Smart Contract or Pallet**: Develop a Substrate pallet or a smart contract (if using a smart contract platform on Substrate) to manage these registrations.
- **Transaction**: Create a transaction that encapsulates the training proof hashes and submit it to the blockchain. This transaction should be signed by the training party's private key to authenticate the submission.

### Implementing with Substrate

Here's a simplified example of how you might implement a pallet for registering model training proofs in Substrate:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

pub use pallet::*;

#[frame_support::pallet]
pub mod pallet {
    use frame_support::{dispatch::DispatchResult, pallet_prelude::*};
    use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;

    #[pallet::pallet]
    #[pallet::generate_store(trait Store)]
    pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

    #[pallet::storage]
    pub(super) type TrainingProofs<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::AccountId, TrainingProof>;

    #[pallet::config]
    pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
        type Event: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::Event>;
    }

    #[derive(Clone, Encode, Decode, PartialEq, RuntimeDebug, Default)]
    pub struct TrainingProof {
        data_hash: Vec<u8>,
        model_hash: Vec<u8>,
        output_hash: Vec<u8>,
        log_hash: Vec<u8>,
    }

    #[pallet::call]
    impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
        #[pallet::weight(10_000)]
        pub fn register_training_proof(origin: OriginFor<T>, proof: TrainingProof) -> DispatchResult {
            let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;

            TrainingProofs::<T>::insert(&who, proof);

            Ok(())
        }
    }
}
```

### Verification

Verification of training proofs can be done by anyone with access to the original data, model, and the registered hashes on the blockchain. They can recompute the hashes using the same methodology and compare them with the registered hashes to verify the training's integrity and authenticity.

### Conclusion

Creating a decentralized proof of model training involves capturing the essence of the training process in a verifiable manner. By leveraging Substrate's blockchain technology, cryptographic hashing, and smart logging techniques, one can establish a transparent, tamper-evident record of AI model training, fostering trust and accountability in decentralized AI ecosystems.
