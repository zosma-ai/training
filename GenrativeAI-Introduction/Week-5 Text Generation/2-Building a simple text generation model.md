Building a text generation model using a transformer with a decoder-only architecture from scratch involves understanding the transformer's core components and how they interact to process and generate text. This tutorial will guide you through creating a simplified version of such a model, akin to GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), focusing on the essential elements: the self-attention mechanism, position-wise feed-forward networks, and the overall architecture.

### Prerequisites

- Python knowledge
- Basic PyTorch understanding
- Familiarity with NLP concepts

### Step 1: Import PyTorch

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import math
```

### Step 2: Implement Multi-Head Self-Attention

The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different positions in the input sequence.

```python
class MultiHeadSelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, heads):
        super(MultiHeadSelfAttention, self).__init__()
        self.embed_size = embed_size
        self.heads = heads
        self.head_dim = embed_size // heads

        assert self.head_dim * heads == embed_size, "Embed size needs to be divisible by heads"

        self.values = nn.Linear(self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=False)
        self.keys = nn.Linear(self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=False)
        self.queries = nn.Linear(self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=False)
        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(heads * self.head_dim, embed_size)

    def forward(self, values, keys, query, mask=None):
        N = query.shape[0]
        value_len, key_len, query_len = values.shape[1], keys.shape[1], query.shape[1]

        # Split embedding into self.heads pieces
        values = self.values(values).view(N, value_len, self.heads, self.head_dim)
        keys = self.keys(keys).view(N, key_len, self.heads, self.head_dim)
        queries = self.queries(query).view(N, query_len, self.heads, self.head_dim)

        energy = torch.einsum("nqhd,nkhd->nhqk", [queries, keys])
        
        if mask is not None:
            energy = energy.masked_fill(mask == 0, float("-1e20"))

        attention = torch.softmax(energy / (self.embed_size ** (1 / 2)), dim=3)

        out = torch.einsum("nhql,nlhd->nqhd", [attention, values]).reshape(
            N, query_len, self.heads * self.head_dim
        )

        return self.fc_out(out)
```

This code defines a `MultiHeadSelfAttention` class using PyTorch, which is a key component of the transformer model architecture. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different positions in the input sequence when predicting each word. Multi-head attention further enriches this mechanism by running through the self-attention process multiple times in parallel, allowing the model to capture different aspects of the sequence each time. Here's a breakdown of how this class works:

### Initialization (`__init__` method)

- `embed_size`: The size of the input embedding vectors.
- `heads`: The number of attention heads.
- `head_dim`: The dimensionality of each attention head, calculated by dividing `embed_size` by `heads`. It is asserted that `embed_size` is divisible by `heads` to ensure equal division.
- Four linear layers are defined:
  - `self.values`, `self.keys`, and `self.queries` transform the input into values, keys, and queries for the attention mechanism, respectively, for each attention head.
  - `self.fc_out`: A fully connected (linear) layer that combines the outputs from all attention heads back into the original embedding size.

### Forward Pass (`forward` method)

- Inputs: `values`, `keys`, `query`, and an optional `mask`.
- The method first reshapes the `values`, `keys`, and `queries` to separate the different heads (`self.heads`). This allows the model to process the input with multiple attention heads in parallel.
- `energy`: Computes the attention scores using a scaled dot-product attention mechanism, where the dot product of queries and keys is scaled down by the square root of the dimensionality of the keys. This helps in stabilizing the gradients. The `torch.einsum` function is particularly useful here for performing batch matrix multiplication efficiently.
- `mask` (if provided): Used to zero out attention scores for certain positions (e.g., for padding tokens in the input sequence), ensuring the model does not attend to these positions. This is important for handling variable-length sequences.
- `attention`: Applies the softmax function to the scaled attention scores (`energy`) across the third dimension (`dim=3`) to obtain the attention weights. The softmax ensures that the weights sum up to 1, making them interpretable as probabilities.
- The attention weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the `values`, producing the final output for each attention head. The outputs of all heads are concatenated and then linearly transformed back to the original embedding size through `self.fc_out`.
- The final output is a tensor containing the attended information for each position in the input sequence, which can be used by subsequent layers in the transformer model.

Overall, this class implements the multi-head self-attention mechanism, allowing the transformer to focus on different parts of the input sequence for each head, enhancing its ability to capture complex dependencies in the data.

### Step 3: Implement a Transformer Block (Decoder Layer)

```python
class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, heads, dropout, forward_expansion):
        super(TransformerBlock, self).__init__()
        self.attention = MultiHeadSelfAttention(embed_size, heads)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embed_size, forward_expansion * embed_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(forward_expansion * embed_size, embed_size),
        )

        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, value, key, query, mask):
        attention = self.attention(value, key, query, mask)
        x = self.dropout(self.norm1(attention + query))
        forward = self.feed_forward(x)
        out = self.dropout(self.norm2(forward + x))
        return out
```

This code defines a `TransformerBlock` class, a fundamental component of the Transformer model architecture, using PyTorch. A Transformer model comprises several of these blocks stacked together, each containing a multi-head self-attention mechanism followed by position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks. This structure allows the model to capture complex dependencies between input and output sequences.

### Class Definition and Constructor
- `class TransformerBlock(nn.Module)`: This line defines a new class named `TransformerBlock`, which inherits from `nn.Module`, PyTorch's base class for all neural network modules.
- The constructor `__init__(self, embed_size, heads, dropout, forward_expansion)` initializes the Transformer block with the following parameters:
  - `embed_size`: The size of the input and output embeddings.
  - `heads`: The number of heads in the multi-head self-attention mechanism. Splitting the attention mechanism into multiple heads allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.
  - `dropout`: The dropout rate used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to 0 during training.
  - `forward_expansion`: A factor by which the inner layer of the feed-forward network expands the dimensionality of its input before compressing it back to `embed_size`.

### Components of the Transformer Block
- `self.attention = MultiHeadSelfAttention(embed_size, heads)`: An instance of the `MultiHeadSelfAttention` class, which performs the self-attention mechanism across multiple heads.
- `self.norm1` and `self.norm2`: Layer normalization applied after the self-attention and feed-forward network, respectively. Normalization stabilizes the learning process by normalizing the input to have zero mean and unit variance.
- `self.feed_forward`: A sequential container with two linear layers and a ReLU activation function in between. This feed-forward network applies the same transformation to each position separately and identically.
- `self.dropout`: A dropout layer that randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor with probability `dropout` using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.

### Forward Pass
- The `forward` method defines the data flow through the Transformer block:
  - `attention = self.attention(value, key, query, mask)`: Computes the self-attention for the inputs. The self-attention mechanism allows each position in the output to attend over all positions in the input sequence. An optional mask can be applied to prevent attention to certain positions.
  - `x = self.dropout(self.norm1(attention + query))`: Applies dropout and layer normalization to the sum of the original query and the output of the self-attention layer, implementing a residual connection.
  - `forward = self.feed_forward(x)`: Passes the result through the feed-forward network.
  - `out = self.dropout(self.norm2(forward + x))`: Applies dropout and layer normalization to the sum of the input to the feed-forward network and its output, adding another residual connection. The final output is returned.

Residual connections around each of the two sub-layers (self-attention and feed-forward) help avoid the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks by allowing gradients to flow directly through the network.

In summary, each `TransformerBlock` captures complex interactions between elements of the input sequence through self-attention and processes these interactions using a feed-forward neural network, with normalization and dropout applied to stabilize and regularize training.

### Step 4: Implement Positional Encoding

Positional encoding adds information about the position of each token in the sequence.

```python
class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, max_len=100):
        super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__()
        pe = torch.zeros(max_len, embed_size)
        position = torch.arange(0, max_len, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)
        div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, embed_size, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / embed_size))
        pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
        pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
        pe = pe.unsqueeze(0)

        self.register_buffer('pe', pe)

    def forward(self, x):
        return x + self.pe[:, :x.size(1)]
```

This code defines a `PositionalEncoding` class in PyTorch, which is an essential component of transformer models for processing sequence data, such as natural language. The class is a subclass of `nn.Module`, making it a custom PyTorch module. Positional encoding is used to inject information about the position of each token in the sequence into its representation, enabling the model to consider the order of tokens.

### Explanation of the Class

- **Class Definition and Constructor**:
  - `class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module)`: This defines a new class named `PositionalEncoding`, which inherits from PyTorch's `nn.Module`.
  - The constructor `__init__(self, embed_size, max_len=100)` initializes the positional encoding module with the specified embedding size (`embed_size`) and a maximum sequence length (`max_len`). These parameters determine the size of the positional encoding matrix.
  
- **Positional Encoding Matrix Initialization**:
  - `pe = torch.zeros(max_len, embed_size)`: Creates a zero matrix with dimensions of `max_len` by `embed_size`, which will hold the positional encodings.
  - `position = torch.arange(0, max_len, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)`: Generates a tensor containing positions (0 to `max_len`-1) and reshapes it to have dimensions `(max_len, 1)`.
  - `div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, embed_size, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / embed_size))`: Calculates the division term used in the sinusoidal functions (sin and cos) for positional encoding. This term helps vary the wavelength of the sinusoidal functions across different dimensions of the embeddings.
  - `pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)`: Assigns the sine of the position times the division term to the even indices of the positional encoding matrix.
  - `pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)`: Assigns the cosine of the position times the division term to the odd indices of the positional encoding matrix.
  - `pe = pe.unsqueeze(0)`: Adds a new dimension at the beginning of the positional encoding tensor, making its shape `(1, max_len, embed_size)`. This is done to facilitate easy addition to the batch of embeddings later.
  - `self.register_buffer('pe', pe)`: Registers `pe` as a buffer in the module. Buffers are tensors that are not considered model parameters (i.e., they are not updated during training), but they should be part of the model's state. Using `register_buffer` ensures that the positional encodings are moved to the correct device alongside the model.

- **Forward Method**:
  - The `forward` method takes an input tensor `x` (the token embeddings) with shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, embed_size)`.
  - `return x + self.pe[:, :x.size(1)]`: Adds the positional encodings to the input embeddings. The positional encoding tensor is sliced to match the sequence length of the input embeddings. This addition allows the model to use the order of the tokens in its processing.

### Summary
Positional encodings are a critical part of transformers, allowing the model to take into account the sequence order of the input data. This implementation uses a fixed sinusoidal pattern for encoding positions, following the original transformer architecture proposed in "Attention is All You Need". The use of sine and cosine functions at different frequencies allows the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions since for any fixed offset k, `PE(pos+k)` can be represented as a linear function of `PE(pos)`.

### Step 5: Building the Decoder-Only Transformer Model for Text Generation

```python
class DecoderOnlyTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, src_vocab_size, embed_size, num_layers, heads, device, forward_expansion, dropout, max_length):
        super(DecoderOnlyTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.embed_size = embed_size
        self.device = device
        self.word_embedding = nn.Embedding(src_vocab_size, embed_size)
        self.positional_encoding = PositionalEncoding(embed_size, max_length)

        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([
            TransformerBlock(embed_size, heads, dropout=dropout, forward_expansion=forward_expansion)
            for _ in range(num_layers)
        ])

        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(embed_size, src_vocab_size)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        embeddings = self.dropout(self.word_embedding(x) + self.positional_encoding(x))
        out = embeddings

        for layer in self.layers:
            out = layer(out, out, out, mask)

        out = self.fc_out(out)
        return out
```

This code defines a `DecoderOnlyTransformer` class in PyTorch, a simplified model inspired by the transformer architecture used in models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). Unlike the original transformer that has an encoder-decoder structure, this model consists only of a decoder part, making it particularly suitable for generative tasks such as text generation. The class extends `nn.Module`, PyTorch's base class for all neural network modules.

### Class Definition and Constructor

- `class DecoderOnlyTransformer(nn.Module)`: Defines a new class named `DecoderOnlyTransformer` which inherits from `nn.Module`.

- The constructor `__init__` initializes the transformer with several parameters:
  - `src_vocab_size`: Size of the source vocabulary.
  - `embed_size`: Dimensionality of embeddings.
  - `num_layers`: Number of transformer blocks (layers) to include in the model.
  - `heads`: Number of attention heads in each Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism.
  - `device`: The device (CPU or GPU) where the model will be allocated.
  - `forward_expansion`: The factor by which to expand the inner dimension of the feed-forward network within each transformer block before compressing it back down to `embed_size`.
  - `dropout`: The dropout rate used for regularization to prevent overfitting.
  - `max_length`: The maximum length of input sequences, used for positional encoding.

- Key components initialized in the constructor:
  - `self.word_embedding`: An embedding layer for converting input token indices into embeddings.
  - `self.positional_encoding`: An instance of the `PositionalEncoding` class, adding information about the position of each token in the sequence.
  - `self.layers`: A `ModuleList` containing the transformer blocks. Each block is an instance of `TransformerBlock`, implementing a part of the transformer architecture, including self-attention and feed-forward networks.
  - `self.fc_out`: A linear layer that projects the output of the last transformer block back to the vocabulary size, used for predicting the next token.
  - `self.dropout`: A dropout layer applied to the embeddings.

### The Forward Method

- The `forward` method defines how the input data `x` flows through the model:
  - `embeddings = self.dropout(self.word_embedding(x) + self.positional_encoding(x))`: The input tokens are first converted into embeddings. Positional encodings are added to these embeddings to incorporate information about the position of each token. Dropout is then applied.
  - The embeddings are passed through each of the transformer blocks in a loop: `for layer in self.layers: out = layer(out, out, out, mask)`. The same `out` tensor is used as the value, key, and query for self-attention since this is a decoder-only model. An optional `mask` can be provided to prevent the model from peeking at the future tokens when generating text.
  - `out = self.fc_out(out)`: The output of the final transformer block is passed through a linear layer to produce logits corresponding to the probability distribution over the vocabulary for each token position.

### Conclusion

The `DecoderOnlyTransformer` class encapsulates a simplified yet powerful transformer architecture tailored for generating sequences, such as text. By leveraging self-attention, it can model complex dependencies between tokens in the input sequence. This model can be trained for tasks like text generation, where it learns to predict the next token based on the previous tokens in a sequence.

### Step 6: Initializing the Model

```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = DecoderOnlyTransformer(
    src_vocab_size=8000,  # Assume a vocabulary size of 8000 for demonstration
    embed_size=512,
    num_layers=6,
    heads=8,
    device=device,
    forward_expansion=4,
    dropout=0.1,
    max_length=100
).to(device)
```

This code snippet is setting up a `DecoderOnlyTransformer` model in PyTorch and preparing it for either training or inference. The snippet is responsible for initializing the model with specific parameters and ensuring it runs on the appropriate hardware (CPU or GPU). Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

### Device Selection
- `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")`: This line checks if CUDA (NVIDIA GPU support) is available. If a GPU is available, it sets `device` to use CUDA, enabling tensor computations to run on the GPU for accelerated performance. If not, it falls back to using the CPU. This is a common practice in PyTorch to make code adaptable to different hardware setups.

### Model Initialization
- `model = DecoderOnlyTransformer(...)`: This line initializes an instance of the `DecoderOnlyTransformer` model with the specified parameters. Each parameter is briefly explained below:
  - `src_vocab_size=8000`: The size of the source vocabulary is set to 8000 tokens. This parameter defines how many unique tokens (e.g., words or subwords) the model can recognize.
  - `embed_size=512`: Each token will be represented as a vector of 512 dimensions. This size is a common choice for medium-sized models.
  - `num_layers=6`: The model will have 6 transformer layers (or blocks) stacked on top of each other. Each layer learns different aspects of the data, allowing for complex representation and understanding.
  - `heads=8`: Within each transformer layer's multi-head self-attention mechanism, there will be 8 heads. Multiple heads allow the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, capturing various relationships in the data.
  - `device=device`: This specifies the device (CPU or GPU) where the model tensors will be allocated. It uses the `device` variable defined earlier.
  - `forward_expansion=4`: This parameter controls the size of the feed-forward network within each transformer block, expanding the internal representation by a factor of 4 before compressing it back down. This expansion allows the model to learn more complex functions.
  - `dropout=0.1`: A dropout rate of 0.1 is used for regularization, meaning 10% of the elements in the dropout layers will randomly be set to zero during training to prevent overfitting.
  - `max_length=100`: This defines the maximum sequence length that the model can handle. Sequences longer than this will need to be truncated, and shorter ones will be padded.

### Moving Model to Device
- `.to(device)`: This method call ensures that the model's parameters (weights and biases) are moved to the specified `device`. If a GPU is available, it allows the model to leverage accelerated computing. Otherwise, the model will run on the CPU.

### Conclusion
The code snippet efficiently sets up a `DecoderOnlyTransformer` model tailored for sequence generation tasks, such as text generation, and ensures that it runs on the most suitable hardware available. This setup is critical for achieving optimal performance during both the training and inference phases of a machine learning project.

### Step 7: Training the Model

Training involves defining a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss for text generation), an optimizer (e.g., Adam), and iteratively updating the model's weights based on the loss computed from the model's predictions and the actual data.

Due to space constraints, the training loop is not included here, but it would involve:
- Tokenizing input text data.
- Passing input data through the model.
- Calculating the loss.
- Backpropagating the loss and updating the model weights.

### Conclusion

This tutorial provided a basic framework for building a decoder-only transformer model from scratch for text generation. While simplified, it covers the fundamental concepts and components necessary for a functioning transformer model. Further exploration can involve adding more sophisticated training routines, experimenting with hyperparameters, and scaling the model for larger datasets.


To backpropagate the loss and update the model weights in the context of training the Decoder-Only Transformer model for text generation, we'll need a dataset, a loss function, and an optimizer. This example will illustrate these steps using a simplified setup. We will assume you have a dataset of tokenized text data ready for training.

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

Ensure you've imported PyTorch and its submodules as needed.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
```

### Step 2: Prepare a Mock Dataset

For the sake of this example, let's create a simple mock dataset of tokenized inputs and targets. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with your dataset, properly preprocessed and tokenized.

```python
# Mock dataset: tokenized input IDs (batch_size, sequence_length)
# Note: Replace this with your actual dataset loader
src_vocab_size = 8000  # Example vocabulary size
sequence_length = 100  # Example sequence length

# Example data: batches of token IDs (random integers simulating tokenized text)
X = torch.randint(0, src_vocab_size, (32, sequence_length))  # Batch size of 32
Y = torch.randint(0, src_vocab_size, (32, sequence_length))  # Targets (shifted input)
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Model, Loss Function, and Optimizer

Following the model definition from the previous response, initialize the model along with the loss function and optimizer.

```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

model = DecoderOnlyTransformer(
    src_vocab_size=src_vocab_size,
    embed_size=512,
    num_layers=6,
    heads=8,
    device=device,
    forward_expansion=4,
    dropout=0.1,
    max_length=sequence_length
).to(device)

loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0005)
```

### Step 4: Training Loop

Now, let's implement the training loop, which includes backpropagating the loss and updating the model weights.

```python
# Mock training loop for demonstration
epochs = 10  # Number of epochs

model.train()  # Set the model to training mode

for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()  # Zero the gradients

    # Assuming X and Y are your input and target sequences
    inputs, targets = X.to(device), Y.to(device)

    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)

    # Reshape outputs and targets to fit the loss function's expected shape
    outputs = outputs.view(-1, outputs.shape[-1])
    targets = targets.view(-1)

    loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets)

    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()

    # Update model parameters
    optimizer.step()

    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

This code snippet outlines a basic training loop for a neural network model in PyTorch, specifically focusing on how to train a model over multiple epochs, calculate loss, perform backpropagation, and update the model's parameters. Here's a breakdown and explanation of each part:

### Setting Up for Training

- `epochs = 10`: This defines the total number of times the training process will iterate over the entire dataset. An epoch is a full pass through the dataset.

- `model.train()`: Sets the model in training mode. This is crucial for certain types of layers (like dropout and batch normalization) that behave differently during training than during evaluation.

### Training Loop

- `for epoch in range(epochs):`: This loop iterates over the dataset `epochs` number of times. Each iteration represents an epoch.

### Zero Gradients

- `optimizer.zero_grad()`: Before calculating the gradients for a new iteration, you need to zero out the gradients from the previous iteration. Gradients in PyTorch accumulate by default, so this step prevents mixing gradient information between batches.

### Preparing Data and Model Forward Pass

- `inputs, targets = X.to(device), Y.to(device)`: Moves the input and target tensors to the specified `device` (CPU or GPU). This ensures that the computation for forward and backward passes is performed on the same device as the model.
  
- `outputs = model(inputs)`: Performs a forward pass through the model with the given `inputs`. The `outputs` are the model's predictions.

### Calculating Loss

- `outputs = outputs.view(-1, outputs.shape[-1])` and `targets = targets.view(-1)`: Before computing the loss, the outputs and targets might need to be reshaped to fit the expected shape of the loss function. For many loss functions (like cross-entropy loss in classification tasks), `outputs` need to be a 2D tensor with shape `[batch_size * sequence_length, num_classes]`, and `targets` should be a 1D tensor with shape `[batch_size * sequence_length]`.

- `loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets)`: Computes the loss using the model's outputs and the actual targets. The `loss_fn` is a loss function that measures the model's prediction error (e.g., `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` for classification tasks).

### Backpropagation and Updating Model Parameters

- `loss.backward()`: Performs backpropagation, computing the gradient of the loss with respect to all model parameters that are set to require gradients.

- `optimizer.step()`: Updates the model parameters based on the gradients computed by `.backward()`. The optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam) determines how this update is done.

### Logging

- `print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")`: Prints the current epoch number and the loss for that epoch. This provides insight into how the model is performing and whether the loss is decreasing over time.

### Conclusion

This code demonstrates the fundamental steps for training a neural network model with PyTorch: preparing data, executing forward passes, computing loss, performing backpropagation, and updating the model's parameters based on gradients. Through iterating over the dataset multiple times (epochs), the model learns to make better predictions by minimizing the loss function.

### Step 5: Monitoring and Evaluation

While the loop above focuses on training, you should also include validation checks within or after each epoch to monitor the model's performance on unseen data. This involves running the model in evaluation mode (`model.eval()`) and calculating the loss (and potentially other metrics) on the validation set without updating the model's weights.

### Conclusion

This simple example demonstrates the core components needed to train a neural network in PyTorch, including backpropagation and weight updates. Remember, the effectiveness of training depends heavily on the quality of your dataset, the appropriateness of your model architecture, and the tuning of hyperparameters such as the learning rate.
